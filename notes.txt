1)What is a container?
Is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.
Can be run on local machines, virtual machines, or deployed to the cloud.
Is portable (and can be run on any OS).
Is isolated from other containers and runs its own software, binaries, configurations, etc.

2)What is an image?
A running container uses an isolated filesystem. 
This isolated filesystem is provided by an image, 
and the image must contain everything needed to run an application - 
all dependencies, configurations, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configurations for the container,
 such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.
